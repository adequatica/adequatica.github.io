There are not many good books about software testing compared to other areas of software development (programming, management, or design). However, the knowledge that can be applied to testing can be learned from other sources.

![Non-Obvious Books for Software Testers](/assets/2022-02-23/00-cover.jpg)

I have compiled a list of non-technical (almost) books that can be recommended for QA engineers:

- **Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**
  - The Timeless Way of Building
- **Design for the Real World**
  - The Design of Everyday Things
- **Foundation (series)**
- **The Phoenix Project**
  - The Goal
  - The Toyota Way
- **The South Pole**
  - The Last Place on Earth
  - Chasing New Horizons

## [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance) by Robert M. Pirsig

![Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](/assets/2022-02-23/zen-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance.jpg)

_Buy: [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values](https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060839872)_

What is quality? It could be a fundamental question for any quality assurance engineer. The author tries to find the answer to this question through the interweaving of various philosophical concepts ([Metaphysics of Quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirsig%27s_Metaphysics_of_Quality)), but the story itself is not overloaded with abstruse philosophical reflections.

After that book, you will look at the «quality» of your software product from an absolutely different angle, and you will never say in an interview that «testing brings better quality to the software product» because it is so complicated that it is better not to dive into these themes unnecessarily.

Pirsig’s next book, «[Lila: An Inquiry into Morals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lila:_An_Inquiry_into_Morals)» is a continuation of «Zen…», but way more philosophical. It dives into the origins of the Metaphysics of Quality and less applies to practical testing.

### [The Timeless Way of Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building) by Christopher Alexander

![The Timeless Way of Building](/assets/2022-02-23/timeless-way-of-building.jpg)

_Buy: [The Timeless Way of Building](https://www.amazon.com/Timeless-Way-Building-Christopher-Alexander/dp/0195024028)_

What makes a building a quality one? What is quality in the context of architecture? Remarkable research which can be transformed from the real world into the software industry. Actually, that is exactly what happened with another of Alexander’s book, «[A Pattern Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language)», which became a prototype of [software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

## Design for the Real World by [Victor Papanek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Papanek)

![Design for the Real World](/assets/2022-02-23/design-real-world.jpg)

_Buy: [Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Real-World-Ecology-Social/dp/0897331532)_

While specialized books talk about web design and user interfaces, this one reveals the fundamental basics of experiences between human and man-made objects (and software is no exception). This book is especially valuable for everyone who deals with [accessibility](https://adequatica.github.io/2021/08/29/accessibility-manual-testing.html).

### The Design of Everyday Things by [Don Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman)

![The Design of Everyday Things](/assets/2022-02-23/design-of-everyday-things.jpg)

_Buy: [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654)_

It is useful to know how the things around us are made. The intention of creating ordinary objects could lead to thoughts on testing unusual ones.

## [Foundation (series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) by Isaac Asimov

![Foundation](/assets/2022-02-23/foundation.jpg)

_Buy: [Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Asimovs-Foundation-Foundations-Prelude/dp/B01EFDEMS8)_

It is the greatest science fiction book series of all time. There are a lot of complex philosophical ideas passing through the series, but regarding global software product development — major breakthroughs require serious shocks (switching methodologies or frameworks, changing team leaders or other members).

Be aware, that the recently released [TV series](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(TV_series)>) does not follow the original plot.

## The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford

![The Phoenix Project](/assets/2022-02-23/phoenix-project.jpg)

_Buy: [The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B078Y98RG8)_

That is a well-known book about DevOps, but actually, it is an excellent novel about all the difficulties of developing complicated software products in conditions of a tight deadline. Testers may find inspiring ideas to improve quality assurance processes.

### [The Goal](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)>) by Eliyahu Goldratt

![The Goal](/assets/2022-02-23/goal.jpg)

_Buy: [The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement-ebook/dp/B002LHRM2O)_

«The Phoenix Project» is not an original, it’s a rewrite of «The Goal» in another setting, which in the format of a business novel, tells about the [theory of constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints). Worth reading.

### The Toyota Way by Jeffrey K. Liker

![The Toyota Way](/assets/2022-02-23/toyota-way.jpg)

_Buy: [The Toyota Way, Second Edition: 14 Management Principles from the World’s Greatest Manufacturer](https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Way-Second-Management-Manufacturer-ebook/dp/B088P46Q9P)_

The roots of «The Goal» and «The Phoenix Project» are grown from the [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System). It is amazing to get acquainted with automobile manufacturing management practices and find so many «modern trends» in software that have already been used over 50 years ago (or what would be worth learning).

## The South Pole by [Roald Amundsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Amundsen)

![The South Pole](/assets/2022-02-23/south-pole.jpg)

_Buy: [The South Pole](https://www.amazon.com/South-Pole-Unabridged-Illustrations-Appendices-ebook/dp/B06XR251TW)_

For some things, planning and preparation are more important than the venture itself. So it is for some software projects — collecting requirements and designing test plans are the most crucial parts of the testing process. Here is an example of what real preparation means.

### The Last Place on Earth by Roland Huntford

![The Last Place on Earth](/assets/2022-02-23/last-place-on-earth.jpg)

_Buy: [The Last Place on Earth: Scott and Amundsen’s Race to the South Pole](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375754741/)_

It is an exploration of the expeditions of Captain Robert F. Scott and Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen in [their attempts to reach the South Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_Amundsen_and_Scott_expeditions). The book compares in detail the ways of planning, management, and attitude to the goals in the context of extreme ventures.

### [Chasing New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasing_New_Horizons) by Alan Stern and David Grinspoon

![Chasing New Horizon](/assets/2022-02-23/chasing-new-horizons.jpg)

_Buy: [Chasing New Horizons: Inside the Epic First Mission to Pluto](https://www.amazon.com/Chasing-New-Horizons-Inside-Mission/dp/1250098963)_

For those of us who used to work according to agile methodologies with one or two-week sprints, it shows how multi-year projects are built ([space mission to Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons)) and how much should be done in advance. There are also a few paragraphs about software testing.
