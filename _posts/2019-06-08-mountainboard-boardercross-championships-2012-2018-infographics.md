Mountainboarding is a tiny sport, but with a strong community of passionate riders. Despite that regular bordercross сhampionships started only six years ago. The organizers of each event act independently, so the results are presented in non-standardized form and I had to spend some time aggregating data in one spreadsheet. Based on that information I made some charts and theses which found interesting.

### 148 riders participated 452 times in 6 championships

### Serbia hosted championships 3 times — 50% of all times

### France and Slovenia were the most participated championships — 88 riders took part in each one
